## About Basecamp on MacBook

**Basecamp on MacBook** focuses on a reliable way to use the Basecamp project-management platform on macOS with a consistent, distraction-reduced experience. You get a dedicated window for your projects, persistent login, and notifications that respect system settings.

For teams and solo users, **Basecamp for macOS** helps keep work in one place‚Äî**to-dos, message boards, schedules, docs/files, and chat**‚Äîso discussions and deadlines stay connected to the actual tasks.

If you prefer a minimal footprint, you can set up **Basecamp as a Progressive Web App (PWA)** using a modern browser. This preserves your sign-in, gives you a focused window, and supports keyboard shortcuts and notifications provided by the browser engine.

This repository emphasizes a **safe, reproducible installation flow** with practical advice on notifications, security, and everyday work patterns on a MacBook.

## üîÑ Standalone Window vs Browser Tabs (if applicable)

| Area | Standalone window (e.g., PWA install) | Browser tabs |
|---|---|---|
| Focus & windowing | Own window, Cmd+Tab switching | Competes with many tabs |
| Notifications | System banners; respects Do Not Disturb | Browser-dependent |
| Sign-in friction | Stays signed in; quick launch from Dock | Easy to lose session |
| Shortcuts & menus | App-like feel and consistent UX | Varies by browser profile |
| Multi-project flow | Separate windows/spaces if desired | One crowded window |
| Distraction control | Fewer unrelated tabs | Higher context-switching risk |
